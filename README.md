# UFC_analysis

Betting on UFC fights is a common practice. While betting odds are given, it can still be difficult to make a decision of where to put your money. I used a public [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mdabbert/ultimate-ufc-dataset) dataset and K-nearest neighbors to develop a classifier to predict the winner of a fight based on metrics such as each fighter's current win or loss streak, height, reach, or total number of knockouts.
